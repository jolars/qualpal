# qualpal {#mainpage}

qualpal is a C++ library for automatically generating qualitative color palettes,
maximizing perceptual distinctiveness and supporting color vision deficiency simulation.

**Features**

- Perceptually uniform color selection (DIN99d color space)
- Color vision deficiency simulation for accessible palettes
- Flexible builder-style API
- Fast algorithms for large color spaces

**CLI Interface**

qualpal also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for
generating color palettes from the terminal. This allows users
to quickly generate color palettes without the need for a full
C++ application. Read more about the CLI in
[the CLI documentation](#cli).

**R Package**

The qualpal library is also packaged for R as
[qualpalr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qualpalr),
which provides a similar API for generating color palettes
from R. This allows users to easily integrate qualpal into their R workflows,
especially for data visualization tasks.
